# Django_Blog
 This is a Django-based web application for a personal landmark blog. The blog allows an admin to post landmarks, which can be viewed by users. Users can explore the places, add them to a "Read Later" list, delete places from the list, view detailed information about each place, leave comments, and manage their own Read Later list
